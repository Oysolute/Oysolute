## Hi there 👋

I decided to start making my small but first project on github and 
I decided since the first thing is simple and the simplest idea.

## How does it work ✔
 
This batch file is made for Roblox but increases the priority for this game 
to high or to any other that can put everyone changing a line in the code. 
It works automatically and gives high priority when the batch file itself is open.

I think that one open batch file will not eat up your entire RAM. 
It’s best to put this batch file in the autoload of the system itself. 
---DON'T WORRY IT'S NOT A VIRUS.---
the code is open and even if you couldn’t find how to view the code, you can certainly look at the code itself using a regular notepad from standard Windows programs

## Where to put it and what to do with it ✋

As I wrote above, it is better to put it into startup with the system itself (Startup). 
You can just go to this folder via Win + R and run “shell:startup” without any quotes. 
And put the file itself or a batch file (SetRobloxPriority.bat) 
or you can just open the batch file in front of the player, 
but it doesn’t even eat 2 MB 
so there’s no need to say that it can reduce the performance of the computer itself
